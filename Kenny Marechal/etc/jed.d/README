Debian JED startup scheme
-------------------------

JED on Debian has a startup scheme that will help packages providing add-on
support to get their code automatically loaded in a site-wide manner.

* Instead of a config file, we use a config directory: At startup, JED will
  evaluate all "*.sl" scripts in /etc/jed.d/.

  Every package has the right to place files into /etc/jed.d/.

  Use names like NN<name>.sl (where "NN" is a two-digit number). The files
  will be parsed in alphabetical order, i.e. files whose name starts with
  "00" will be loaded first and with "99" last.  (See Debian-Jed-Policy.txt
  for details).

* Evalutation of /etc/jed.d/ can be suppressed by the --skip-debian-startup
  command line option.

* /etc/jed.d/ is not evaluated if Jed is started as `jed-script`.

  If a script depends on the Debian configuration, it can call the function
  debian_startup() defined in defaults.sl.


* Files in /etc/jed.d/ are configuration files. The system administrator can
  modify them or add scripts for site-wide Jed configuration.

* The order of parsing the JED config settings is thus as follows:

   * /usr/share/jed/lib/site.sl     % upstream basic setup

   * /usr/share/jed/lib/defaults.sl % Debian provided code for evaluation of
                                    % the "jed.d" directory contents

   % no call to /etc/jed.conf

   * /etc/jed.d/*.sl                % package configuration files

   * ~/.jed/jed.rc                  % user config file (if it exists),
                                    % skipped with the -n command line option)
     or ~/.jedrc                    % if ~/.jed/ doesnot exist


   * keybindings file               % either user-set in jed.rc or
                                    % according to _Jed_Default_Emulation
                                    % default is /usr/share/jed/lib/emacs.sl

   * command_line_options

   * files given on the command line
